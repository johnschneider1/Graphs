        explore all possible paths of graph
        start at root/start node like bfs, instead of going across levels, it goes one branch at a time, only explore nodes 1 time
        goes down each branch one at a time, then moves onto next branch, continually checks complete paths
        1. begin at the starting vertex
        2. expolore that vertex
           a. if unexplored, adjacent vertex
             explore adjacent vertex
           b. 

           once u reach end of stack, you pop last item added
           search down complete branches not across levels like bfs
           good algo if your solution is very far from root node
