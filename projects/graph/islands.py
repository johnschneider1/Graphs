# Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands.
# An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:
# islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
#            [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

# island_counter(islands) # returns 4

# island[0][4] the 0 referes to the first list, the 4 is the 4th item in that list

# connected - has edges
# array/2d
# n, s, e, w
# binary
# island
# return 1 islands
